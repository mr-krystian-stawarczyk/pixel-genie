However, we do recommend a professional (developer) to complete more complex changes and maintenance such as plugin updates, design or structure changes, and complex functionality requirements.

	"web99": "How much input do I have in the website design process?",
	"web100": "A lot! Your input and feedback is crucial to this website design and development process. We’ll start with a lot of questions about your needs, your likes, your wants and work with you to develop just the right look and functionality. We also request you to provide sample websites before we begin your project. Remember this is your website and we need your help and direction as to your final vision.
