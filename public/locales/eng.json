	"web86": "There is no one specific answer to that question. The cost of website development is based on the individual needs of each project.

Please contact us at info@pixel-genie.de to start the estimation process!",
	"web87": "How long will it take to complete my website?",
	"web88": "Our standard schedule assumes that website development will take 3 to 6 weeks, but it depends on the project, as the size and pace of each project are determined by the client. The amount of information you can provide in the initial stages, your feedback, the speed of content delivery—all of these factors affect the timeline.

After the migration, you will receive full access to the Sanity dashboard to make simple text updates, change images, add new products, and adjust prices. However, we recommend seeking the help of a professional (developer) for more complex changes and maintenance, such as plugin updates, design or structural modifications, and advanced functional requirements. After completing the website, we offer paid individual lessons at a rate of 99 EUR + VAT per hour if you're interested in learning how to navigate the admin panel and make minor updates yourself.",
	"web93": "Will you maintain our website?",
	"web94": "We can assist in maintaining your website, or you can do it yourself for minor changes. The choice is entirely yours. We provide support to many of our clients, but it's not mandatory, and there won't be a monthly fee. You can reach out to us when you need updates on your website, and we will provide a quote based on your requests.",
	"web95": "Do you provide hosting and domain for the website?",
	"web96": "Hosting and domain are discussed during the initial conversation. We offer the option of hosting and domain on our own servers, but we have no objection to your own initiative :)",
	"web97": "Will my website be mobile-friendly?",
	"web98": "Absolutely! Having a responsive website is now more important than ever! We work hard to ensure that your website is mobile-friendly and compatible with modern browsers.",
	"web99": "How much influence do I have on the website design process?",
	"web100": "A lot! Your feedback and information are crucial in the website design and development process. We will start with many questions about your needs, preferences, and requirements, and then collaborate with you to create the appropriate look and functionality. We also ask you to provide us with sample websites before starting the project. Remember, it's your website, and we need your input and guidance regarding the final vision. We are a team and look forward to your ideas.",

	"seo63": "What does SEO stand for?",
	"seo64": "As you may know, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. But what does that mean? And what does search engine optimization entail? In short, SEO is focused upon acquiring website traffic and high search result rankings organically. By organic, we mean without paying for web traffic via pay-per-click ads, among other methods. Within SEO, there’s a wide variety of strategies to accomplish the aforementioned goals—some of which are more effective than others. This could be anything from developing website content around keywords related to your industry to maintaining a strong presence across multiple social media platforms. SEO practices and strategies are constantly changing to remain effective as internet search engines continuously update algorithms.",
	"seo65": "How much does SEO cost?",
	"seo66": "To answer this question our SEO team would need to know more information about your business. We can tell you one thing though, from our 5+ years of analysing thousands of SEO campaigns, the biggest reason why most campaigns fail (possibly yours in the past too), is that the company fails to properly assess the amount of work required to get you a great result and ROI. That being said, our SEO packages range from 249-10,000 EUR per month with no-contract.",
	"seo67": "How long does SEO take?",
	"seo68": "To answer this question depends greatly on where you are today, what SEO has been done before, and what your competition levels are like. As a general rule of thumb, most websites on page 2 can be brought to the first page inside 3 months. As for a brand new website, you’re looking closer to 6+ months to get good first page rankings on competitive keywords. During that time your leads and traffic will increase gradually and regularliy, but the big wins are once you hit the top half of the first page.",
	"seo69": "What is the ROI on SEO?",
	"seo70": "Generally more than you could ever imagine. We’ve had clients grow their online sales by 1000% in 16-months, which represented an ROI of over 20X. However, the true value in SEO is that the traffic and leads you acquire last for a very long time. For example – our SEO specialists did the calculations and a Plumber in Toronto, from a 12-month custom SEO campaign could receive over 25X their money back in profit over the 12-months after their campaign is completed. Yet in the following 12-months, when they aren’t spending on SEO, their ROI jumps as high as 50X!",
	"seo71": "Can you get me to #1 on Google?",
	"seo72": "Our team of SEO specialists will get you to the best possible position for your market, and flood your business with new organic traffic. From our 6+ years of SEO experience, it’s better to focus on ranking your business for the right keywords than just chasing #1’s. If #1 is possible for the right terms, then we’ll give it everything to get you there.",
	"seo73": "Will my results drop if I stop doing SEO?",
	"seo74": "SEO is much like going to the gym. After working out for 12-months straight, you’re going to be in great shape, and even if you stop for 3-months, you’re going to maintain a pretty good physique. However over time your results will drop off, and you’ll need a tune up. The same is true for your SEO. Everything we do is permanent & long term, however with time your competition may work and out-rank you. If this happens after your campaign ends, simply give our SEO team a call and we will walk you through how we fix it.",
	"seo75": "I’ve done SEO before and it hasn’t worked, why are you different?",
	"seo76": "If SEO hasn’t worked then one of four things has occurred: You’ve been ripped off by a scammer – Sadly there are a lot in this SEO industry, and if this has happened to you, we’re truly sorry – stopping these people is the reason our team is so passionate about Search Engine Optimization. You were working with a website designer, developer, or marketing agency – SEO is a lot like brain surgery. It’s a very detailed, specific skillset that very few people truly possess. A lot of website design, marketing, or graphic design companies offer ‘SEO’ as a service, however they are not experienced in the craft. They are good at many things, but you don’t want your logo designer doing your SEO. Your SEO company didn’t know what they were doing – This is much more common than you would think. You see, lots of people start ‘SEO’ companies after watching a few YouTube videos, or buying a $4 e-Book. They think that they can learn along the way, and sadly, they convince many business owners that they know what they are doing when they truly have no clue. SEO, is a skill set that takes decades to master and hiring a newbie disguised as a guru will leave you disappointed in your rankings. Your company didn’t do enough to beat tough competition – If you paid $100, or even $500/month for SEO in the past, then chances are your campaign wasn’t aggressive enough, or have enough effort and resources required to beat out tough competition. As the saying goes, “If you think a professional is expensive, wait until you work with an amateur”. Our SEO specialists can generally pinpoint with sniper like precision why your past campaign hasn’t worked in minutes. Our SEO team can look at all of your website statistics and compare them directly with your competitors. Let us show you why your SEO efforts in the past haven’t worked.",

	"seo87": "Is there any guarantees for our SEO service?",
	"seo88": "Know that no one can guarantee you to rank #1 on Google. While many SEO companies guarantee a number-one ranking, Google ultimately makes that decision, and no SEO company has a special relationship with Google. Again, the relationship between a guarantee for top rankings and shady SEO companies is strong enough that Google recommends running away. Our guarantee is that nobody will work harder to get you the rankings you deserve than our SEO team.",
	"seo89": "Is SEO dead?",
